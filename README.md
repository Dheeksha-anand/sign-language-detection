# 🌟 **Sign Language Detection Application**

## Welcome to the Sign Language Detection Application

A powerful tool leveraging deep learning to analyze and classify sign language gestures, enabling real-time communication and interaction through a webcam-based system.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

✨ **Real-Time Detection**  
Accurately detects and classifies sign language gestures through webcam feeds using a pre-trained deep learning model.

✨ **Customizable Outputs**  
Easily adapt the system for additional gestures or specialized applications.

✨ **High Performance**  
Optimized for real-time processing with minimal latency.

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**

- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch (YOLO framework)  
- **Preprocessing**: Data preparation using labeled images  
- **Programming**: Python

## 💻 **Installation Guide**

**Clone the repository**:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sign-language-detection.git  
cd sign-language-detection  
```

**Install dependencies**:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

**Run the application**:  
```bash  
python detect_sign_language.py  
```

## 🧪 **How It Works**

1. **Webcam Activation**: Opens your webcam to capture live video input.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Applies transformations to the input frames for optimal model performance.  
3. **Prediction**: A deep learning model predicts gestures from the live feed.  
4. **Output Display**: Displays the gesture label (e.g., `hello`, `yes`, `thanks`) in real-time.

## ✨ **Workflow**

### **Data Preprocessing**

- Input frames are resized and normalized for the model.
- Predictions are refined for accuracy.

### **Model Training**

- Trained using a YOLO-based model on a labeled dataset of sign language gestures.  
- The model achieves high accuracy on detecting gestures such as `hello`, `please`, and `thanks`.  

### **Model Saving**

- The trained model is saved as `best.pt` for easy deployment.

### **Execution**

**Train the Model**  
Train the model if needed:  
```bash  
python train_model.py  
```  
This script:  
- Prepares data for training.  
- Trains a YOLO-based model.  
- Saves the trained model as `best.pt`.  

**Start the Detection Script**  
```bash  
python detect_sign_language.py  
```
